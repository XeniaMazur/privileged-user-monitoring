      <h3>Remote vendor monitoring</h3>
      <h5>Directly minimize the risks associated with
vendor activity across your enterprise</h5>
       <p>Hold your vendors accountable and avoid any unnecessary activity. It is simple to see (and prove) exactly how vendors spent their time working on company servers, eliminating “who did what?” doubts, confirming SLA agreements and easing vendor billing verification.</p>

        <p>Giving external vendors access to your internal systems greatly increases the risk that their privileges will be used to steal your company information or damage your infrastructure (mistakes made while deploying code, conﬁguring systems or assigning user permissions).

      <h4>BEHAVIORAL ANALYTICS</h4>
      <p>All Remote Vendors activity is captured and calculated in real-time into an overall risk score and presented to the security team in form of a User Risk Dashboard. The dashboard lists the remote vendors sorted by the most risk vendors to the least risky. The risky vendors can be filtered and sorted according to the number of out-of-policy notifications and behavior trends – providing an easy way to identify those remote vendors who constantly violate security policies and those who keep ignoring them despite being warned or even blocked.</p>

  <h4>FULL SESSION RECORDING OF REMOTE VENDOR ACTIVITY</h4>
  <p>ObserveIT also captures all of the remote vendors activity in an easy-to-use video recording, that is smart enough to only record the parts of the screen that were actually changed. Idle time is not recorded (although, if needed, continuous recording is also an option). This makes the recorded data much smaller than you would expect. Sessions are recorded in real-time and stored in a SQL Server database, where they are analyzed and indexed. You can use keyword phrases to search for any metadata collected in the recorded sessions.</p>

The notification message can be triggered each time the rule is violated, or alternatively only once per each user session.</p>
    <p>Blocking Messages that block users from whatever they were doing – forcing them to review the message, acknowledge it, and asking them to provide a comment explaining their actions (optional) before they can continue with their work.</p>

<h4>RECOMMENDED SYSTEM
DEPLOYMENT </h4>
<h6>SET UP A GATEWAY SERVER FOR REMOTE
APPLICATION ACCESS</h6>
<p>While not absolutely required, it is strongly recommended to set up a “gateway server” through which remote vendors will access your servers. A gateway server is simply a Windows machine (or virtual machine) running Remote Desktop Services (RDS), preferably with RemoteApp or Citrix XenApp running above it. This gateway server approach provides greatly enhanced security: instead of providing remote vendors with remote desktop access to the entire server, the gateway server can limit vendor access to the specific application(s) they need to be using.</p>

  <h2>SIEM INTEGRATION</h2>
  <h5>ObserveIT dramatically enhances any SIEM or log management application by incorporating video playback of user sessions directly into the SIEM console. This combination provides a number of important benefits:</h5>
  <img id="picture8" src="../images/pictureBlock-8.png">
  <ul>
    <li>Add user session data to SIEM dashboards and reports – including lists of every application run, pie charts showing active users/servers and even detailed listings of specific user actions, all linked directly to video recordings of user sessions</li>
    <li>Correlate system log data with user activity data – with detailed user activity drill-down and one-click access to the relevant portion of any recorded session video, for a much better understanding of what was done by any user on any server in any application</li>
    <li>Fill in SIEM logging gaps – for applications without any built-in logging (including legacy, bespoke, commercial and cloud applications), plus all system areas, on Windows, UNIX and Linux machines accessed via any connection method (direct console, SSH, Telnet, Remote Desktop, etc.)</li>
    <li>Improve regulation compliance and reduce security auditing costs – without the need for complex research and correlation projects, by instantly finding any user action and playing back relevant portions of recorded session videos</li>

    <h2>SERVICE DESK INTEGRATION</h2>
    <h5>ObserveIT integration with change management solutions are available out of the box. Integrating ObserveIT's session recording system with change management tools can provide your organization with additional layers of security and monitoring unavailable in any other approach.</h5>

<div id="twelfthBlock">
<div id="twelfthWrapper">
<div id="leftPart7">
  <p>You can require specific administrators and/or remote vendors to enter a valid ticket number from your change management system before being able to log into specific servers. By linking every login to a particular ticket, unnecessary and unauthorized logins are reduced and there is greater enforcement of segregation of duties.</p>
  <p>Once a ticket number is provided as part of the server login process, ObserveIT automatically augments the ticket data with key details about the login session which are only available to ObserveIT. For example, the ticket will include the actual user name used to access the server (based on a secondary identification login which goes beyond generic system admin login accounts), the particular server which was accessed and the exact date/time that the session occurred.</p>

  <p>The ticket record will include a direct link to the visual recording of the particular session in which the remote vendor addressed the ticket. This provides the unique ability to visually review exactly how the user addressed the ticket. Linking a video recording of their actions addressing a ticket from within the ticket itself allows faster and easier auditing of the exact actions performed by remote vendors.</p>
  <p>When a remote vendor for whom this feature is enabled attempts to log in to a monitored server, a window similar to the one at the right appears. The ticket number entered is validated against the change management database in real time before the user is granted access to the system.</p>
