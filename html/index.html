happens on sensitive servers</h4><p>Privileged Session Recording makes it easy to detect leaks of sensitive and regulated information, because every privileged user action is monitored and analyzed in real-time. ObserveIT provides screen-recording technology to capture all user behavior, regardless of the environment. Beyond providing video playback of all user activity, ObserveIT turns these video recordings into metadata that can be easily searched, analyzed, audited and acted upon.</p></div>

          <h2>ZERO-GAP MONITORING, ANALYSIS, ALERTING AND INTERVENTION</h2>
          <p>ObserveIT monitors, records and analyzes privileged user activity in every application, Web page and window. Beyond Windows servers, ObserveIT also supports Windows desktop and Unix/Linux environments, regardless of how users log in (Remote Desktop, Terminal Services, VMware, GoToMyPC, LogMeIn, SSH, Telnet, ICA, local login, etc.). Addressing a major security gap in most organizations, ObserveIT even generates user activity logs and screen recordings for commercial, legacy, bespoke and cloud apps, including those with no internal logging facilities of their own.</p>

          <p>Administrators can observe live sessions in progress and can lock a session and user account from within ObserveIT if they wish to immediately stop a suspicious or dangerous activity. This is particularly useful in the event that the system generates a real-time alert: the administrator receiving the alert can view all activity occuring in the live session screen, rewind to see the actions that led up the alert and take immediate action to prevent further risk.</p>

          <p>Additionally, the recordings and resulting user activity logs are valuable for root cause analysis, ad hoc IT forensics and regulatory compliance audit reporting. Reports can be customized to specific business needs and can be scheduled or run on demand.</p>
